# Cricket-Over-Scorer
A simple yet effective C++ console application that mimics the scoring logic of a real cricket match over!

✅ Ball-by-Ball Input :
Users can enter data for each ball (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 runs, wickets, wides, no-balls).
Simulates real-time scorekeeping for a single over (6 legal deliveries).

✅ Score Calculation :
Accurately tracks total runs, wickets, and extra runs.
Handles extras like wide balls and no balls with automatic score and ball adjustments.

✅ Dynamic Over Display:
After each input, it shows an updated over status (like 1 4 Wd 2 Nb 6 w 0).

✅ Modular & Beginner-Friendly Code :
Great for those practicing basic C++ syntax and control structures.
Teaches how to use switch-case, arrays, and loops interactively.
